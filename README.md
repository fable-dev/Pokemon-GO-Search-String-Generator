# Pokemon-GO-Search-String-Generator

To Do:-
- ~~When typing name of the pokemon, give me a list of pokemon as I am typing it, case insensitive.~~
- ~~Add advanced setting hidable menu where Use and Or, Replace append lives.~~
- Make the save string a scrollable list with max of 5 shown at a time.
- Make a way to search through saved strings.
- Make it so that only unique strings are stored. String name and the string value should be unique. Basically, no two entries can have the same name (e.g., "Trash") or have identical string data. Duplicate names or duplicate values should not be allowed in the list.
- Add Multi Delete String
- ~~Wrap the string name if too big, or limit the string name to 20 chars.~~
- Tooltip around the Quick Filters which when clicked will show the string in filter?
